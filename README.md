You can see the application running at [https://mail-box-ichetanya-chetanya-agarwals-projects.vercel.app] or [https://mail-box-chetanya-agarwals-projects.vercel.app]

## Assumptions and Current State

1. I have used 3 icons(back-arrow,hamburger and cross icons) in the mobile view of the app. These icons were not provided in the design.

2. I've assumed that side-bar would be collapsable on mobile screens.
